🕹 Adventure RPG Game (Python + Flask)
📌 Project Overview

This project is a console-style text adventure game built with Python (Flask framework) that runs in the browser.
The player explores a branching storyline inside a dark cave, facing challenges like fighting dragons 🐉, discovering treasures 💎, and making survival choices.

The game uses a "choose your own adventure" style where the player types commands (fight, run, open, etc.) and the story unfolds based on those decisions.

Health (HP) system → player starts with 100 HP, can lose or gain HP.

Score system → earn points for defeating enemies and finding treasure.

Clean retro console-style UI (green text on black background).
